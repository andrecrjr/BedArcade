# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure and Module Organization

- `desktop/` contains the Rust desktop app, tests, and platform documentation.
- `extension/entrypoints/content.ts` runs the browser extension gamepad loop, manages focus, and activates selected controls.
- `extension/entrypoints/background.ts` handles browser tab actions such as back, next tab, and previous tab.
- `extension/lib/spatial.ts` finds visible, enabled candidates and chooses the nearest target by direction.
- `extension/lib/gamepad.ts` reads real browser gamepad state and provides controlled input frames to E2E builds.
- `extension/tests/e2e/` contains Playwright tests against local pages loaded with WXT.
- `extension/wxt.config.ts` defines the extension manifest; `extension/tsconfig.json` enables strict TypeScript checking.
- `extension/README.md` documents the browser extension. WXT generates the unpacked extension under `extension/.output/chrome-mv3`.
- Root `package.json` and `.releaserc.json` configure semantic-release for the desktop app.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `make web-install` installs the extension dependencies.
- `make web-dev` starts WXT development mode.
- `make web-typecheck` runs TypeScript without emitting files.
- `make web-lint`, `make web-format`, and `make web-format-check` run Oxlint and Oxfmt.
- `make web-build` creates a production extension build; `make web-package` creates its ZIP.
- `make web-test` builds the WXT `e2e` mode and runs Playwright against Chromium; run `npx playwright install chromium` from `extension/` once to install its browser.
- `make desktop-run`, `make desktop-check`, `make desktop-lint`, `make desktop-format`, and `make desktop-test` run the Rust app workflows.
- `make desktop-linux-package` and `make desktop-windows` create platform release packages.

## Coding Style and Naming Conventions

Use strict TypeScript and preserve the existing two-space indentation, single quotes, and semicolons in `extension/`. Prefer explicit types at browser API and message boundaries. Use `camelCase` for variables and functions; keep module filenames lowercase. Run the configured Oxfmt and Oxlint commands for finished changes.

## Testing Guidelines

Before submitting, run the relevant extension format, lint, typecheck, and build commands, plus the desktop format, lint, check, and test commands. E2E tests use deterministic standard-mapped input frames and verify focus movement, activation, pause/resume, browser history, and tab switching. Physical controller behavior still needs manual validation; automated extension coverage targets Chromium and standard mappings.

## Commits and Pull Requests

This checkout has no Git metadata, so no project-specific commit convention can be verified. Use a short imperative commit subject. A pull request should describe the user-visible change, list validation performed, link a related issue when available, and include screenshots for visible UI changes.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **Gamepad-Navigator** (338 symbols, 754 relationships, 28 execution flows).

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze --index-only` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? Bootstrap with `npx`, `bunx`, or `pnpm dlx` — e.g. `bunx gitnexus@latest analyze` (npm 11 npx crash; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing.** Use `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs impact "symbolName" --direction upstream --repo .` (CLI fallback); report callers, processes, and risk. Never substitute grep for graph analysis.
- **MUST analyze graph changes before committing.** Use `detect_changes({scope: "all"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope all --repo .` (CLI fallback). `partial: true` or `truncated: true` is not a clean check — a zero means unseen, not unaffected; re-run it. For regression review: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope compare --base-ref "main" --repo .`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- **MUST treat `risk: UNKNOWN` as unresolved, not as low.** An empty caller set is not evidence the symbol is unused — it can also mean the callers are not resolvable by the index (plain-object property access, dynamic dispatch, cross-language calls). `impact` pairs `UNKNOWN` with a `riskNote` saying so. Confirm with a text search before treating the symbol as safe to change or delete; do not proceed on the strength of a zero.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method before MCP/CLI impact analysis.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis, and never read `UNKNOWN` as an all-clear — it means the walk could not answer, which is the one verdict that requires confirming by other means.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit before MCP/CLI graph change analysis.
